# Aahaar - Feeding Generations

Aahaar is a web portal that connects surplus food nodes like banquet halls and caterers with people in need through NGOs, orphanages, and old age homes to donate the surplus food post social events. Our mission is to reduce food waste and ensure that minimal food is wasted, while also providing nutritious meals to people in need.
